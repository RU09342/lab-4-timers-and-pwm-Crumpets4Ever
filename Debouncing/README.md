## Software Debouncing
The simplest way to debounce is to wait until the button is no longer bouncing. This was done by disabling the button interrupt once it is fired off and then re-enabling in the timer interrupt. Additionally the timer is made "slower" so that the bounces are not seen and so the button interrupts aren't triggered. The period is changed by adjusting CCR0 (or CCR1 for the 2311) and making it longer or shorter. The end value was found experimentally by maximizing the speed at which the button can be pressed and the time allotted for the timer to tick again.
